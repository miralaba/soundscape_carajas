# Amazon Rainforest Soundscape Analysis

## Introduction
This GitHub repository hosts data and R scripts for our study on the impact of environmental variables on soundscape indices in the Amazon rainforest's undegraded primary forests. The study focuses on understanding temporal and frequency masking effects on these indices and their efficacy as tools for environmental monitoring.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into the following folders:

- `data/`
  - Contains raw acoustic data files from the Amazon biome.
  
  
- `scripts/`
  - `_soundscape.R`: For data preprocessing and soundscape index extraction.
  
  - `_analyses.R`: Contains statistical analysis workflow.
  
  
- `results/`
  - Stores main figures from the analyses.
